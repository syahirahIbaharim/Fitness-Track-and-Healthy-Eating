<h3>About Me üê≥</h3>
Hi, my name is Nur Syahirah Binti Ibaharim and I'm a computer science student in USM.<br>
<p><h3>My Final Year Project</h3></p>
Title: Student Personal Assistance <br>
Subsystem 1: My Study Life (iStudy)<br>
Subsystem 2: Social Network (MyCircle)<br>
Subsystem 3: Fitness Track and Healthy Eating (beFit)<br> </br>

Student Personal Assistance is owned by University Science Malaysia (USM). </br>
The system‚Äôs users will be university students in USM. </br>
They will use the system by downloading the app through their mobile phones </br>
as the system developed is a mobile application. Student Personal Assistance </br>
would benefit the organization in terms that it would help the students to balance their academics, social, and health. 

<h3>My FYP subsystem</h3>
<h4> Fitness Track and Healthy Eating (beFit):runner::green_apple: </h4>
This subsystem focuses on the healthy life of the students in terms of fitness tracking  <br />
and healthy eating to keep adopting a healthy lifestyle. <br />
