<h3>My FYP subsystem</h3>
<h4> Fitness Track and Healthy Eating :runner::green_apple: </h4>
This subsystem is used to keep track of student fitness. It allows students to create their avatars and <br />
keep track of all the physical activities they do daily, such as walking, eating, or exercising. <br />
Whenever the user completes the desired task, they will be rewarded with some points.
